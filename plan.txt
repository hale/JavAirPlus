every minute the simulation runs:


evey other minute a new passenger arrives.  
    the new passenger has only one property: meal(10), drink(8) or budget(6).
    a passenger has a 0.2 chance of buying a meal ticket, 0.3 chance of a drink and 0.5 of a budget.
    a meal passenger takes 10 minutes to check in, drink 8, budget 6.
    if there is a check in desk in the collection that has space free in it's queue, the passenger joins that desk
    otherwise, a new desk is created and the passenger joins that queue. 
every minute the queues are processed.  
    the person at the front of the queue has one minute taken off their time.  
    if their time is zero, they are removed from the queue


2:3:5

there is a 0.2 chance of a random number between 0 and 100 being 20 or less.  
there is a 0.3 chance of a random number 


given a random number between 0 and 100....
  there is a 0.2 chance it is 20 or less
  there is a 0.3 chance it is 20 to 50
  there is a 0.5 chance it is larger than 50
